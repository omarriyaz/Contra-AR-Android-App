# Contra-AR-Android-App

Contra, a social media/scrapbooking platform allowed users to create and share scrapbooks using AR technology. Built with React Native and Viro, the app enabled users to seamlessly post and interact with AR-enhanced scrapbooks. The implementation of Contra utilized React Native for the front-end and Firebase Realtime Database for the back-end. React Native, an open-source JavaScript framework, enabled the development of the Android application by allowing code reuse across both iOS and Android platforms. This led to faster development times and reduced costs. React Native's pre-built, customizable UI components facilitated the creation of complex and responsive interfaces. The framework's support for hot reloading allowed real-time code changes. Additionally, React Native's ability to integrate with native code enabled access to device-specific features, such as the camera.
