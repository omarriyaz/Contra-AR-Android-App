# Contra-AR-Android-App

Contra, a social media/scrapbooking platform allowed users to create and share scrapbooks using AR technology. Built with React Native and Viro, the app enabled users to seamlessly post and interact with AR-enhanced scrapbooks. Our group achieved an A grade for presenting the project at an Expo and submitting comprehensive documentation, including design and implementation reports, evaluation reports, and guides.
